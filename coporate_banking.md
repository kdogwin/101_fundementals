## 2. Corporate Banking Products (Business Models) <a name="cbp"></a>
The basic business model of a corporate bank is similar to a commerical bank which is the banks lending arm to individuals and businesses. The idea is to use customer deposits to make loans and then earn a profit on the spread.<br>
The corporate banking takes the same approach but works with corporations and the loans are on a much larger scale.<br>
The two bread and butter corporate banking products are 'revolvers' and 'term loans'.
### Revolver (Revolving Credit Facilities)
RCF is a loan that acts like a credit card for a large corporations. With a revolver, a certian amount up to some predifined limit can be drawn and repaid as needed. The corporate bank charges fees on the drawn amount (utilisation fee) and a spread. In addition a small upfront fee for putting the loan package together.
### Term Loans
Term loans are 'bread and butter' loans in which the borrower draws the entire facility up front, incurs interest and repays the full balance sheet at the end of the term. Term loans are used to fund capital expenditures, operating acitivties and leverage buyouts. <br>
Pricing on term loans is largely the same as revolvers utilisation fees. Term loans are more lucrative for the corporate bank because unlink revolvers, the whole amount is drawn and therefore earns strong lending returns.
### Bridge Finance
Usually for interim funding for M&A (mergers and aqusitions) transactions before more permanent capital is raised. Can be lucrative products.
### Letters of Credit
A letter from the bank promising payment will be made, effectively replacing the credit risk of the borrower with that of a bank.
## 3. Corporate Banking as "Loss Leader" (giving a good deal) <a name="cbll"></a>
Coporate banking is closely tied to the mergers and qauasitions advisory and capital markets divisions within an investment bank.<br>
This means that within the investement bank, coporate banking often functions as a 'loss leader' to foster stronger overall investement banking relationships.<br>
Banks often give nice client loan offers as they can be cross sold on additional banking services or want to build a long-term relationship.
